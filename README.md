# Mech105
This repository contains several files from Mech 105, also known as numerical methods, a 100 level engineering course taught at CSU. the files contained within are several different matlab algorithms that perform calculations such as LU factorization (a method utilized to solve systems of linear equations), or bisection (a numerical method for finding the roots of a function).

**All codes were created in matlab**
