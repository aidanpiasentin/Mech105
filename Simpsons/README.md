## Simpson Rule
This algorithm implements the simpsons 1/3 rule, a mathematical method for approximating the area under a given curve (the integral). This algorithm is based off of:
* evenly spaced data in (x,y) form
* whether there is an even or odd number of points NOTE: if there is an even number of points this will result in an uneven number of regions to integrate over, therefore the trapezoidal rule will be utilized to calculate the final region's area
